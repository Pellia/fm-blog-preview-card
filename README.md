- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I explored variable fonts and learned how to implement them, instead of relying on multiple static font variations.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url("../assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-display: swap;
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 100 1000;
}
```

### Useful resources
